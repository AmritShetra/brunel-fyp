    <string name="intro_message">Hi! I\'m Carl the Chatbot, happy to help. Do you have any items to recycle, or do you need help with something else?</string>
    <string name="other_option_response">Something else? Sure. I can help you out with a few things!</string>
    <string name="other_option_1_response">Trophies are essentially an achievement/reward system.
        \n\nYou can earn trophies for completing various recycling activities.
        \n\nIn the Trophies tab, you can see which ones you\'ve unlocked, and how to get more!
        \n\nGood luck :)</string>
    <string name="other_option_2_response">This is a final year project app, so a lot of features have only recently been finished.
        \n\nFeel free to provide feedback for anything you would like added to the app.</string>
    <string name="recycle_instruction">You would like to recycle an item, sure thing.
        \n\nYou\'ll need to take a photo of the recycling code on the side of the packaging so I can tell you what to do!
    </string>
    <string name="try_again">Hmm, looks like that didn\'t work.
        \n\nLooks like there are some connection issues. Check your internet connection, and let\'s try that again!
